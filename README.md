# Google Maps JavaScript API Sample Application

This sample is generated from @googlemaps/js-samples located at
https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples.

## Setup
To use this demo, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then, to run the project:

```sh
npm i
npm start  # development
npm run build  # production
```
 * If "npm start" doesn't work, try "npm i -D --save-exact mini-css-extract-plugin@2.4.5".


(now runing with API key, but i'll keep this info here)
The application is currently using the `.env` file to embed the API key in the
HTML document. This is a temporary key and is not valid for production usage. It
can be replaced by following these instructions to
[get an api key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
